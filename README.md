# Data Structures

This project contains the various data structures and the implementation of the data structures using C#.

Tools Used:
 - VS Code

Below is the list of Data Structures and Algorithms that are part of the projects.

Data Structure
 - N/A

Sort Algorithm
 - Bubble Sort
    - In-Place Algorithm
    - O(n2) - Quadratic
    - Stable Sort Algorithm
 - Selection Sort
    - In-Place Algorithm
    - O(n2) - Quadratic
    - Un-Stable Sort Algorithm
    - Better than bubble sort, because the number of swaps is less than bubble sort
- Insertion Sort
    - In-Place Algorithm
    - O(n2) - Quadratic
    - Stable Sort Algorithm
- Shell Sort
    - In-Place Algorithm
    - O(n2) - Quadratic, but we can improve this by using a Gap that is greater than 1. Refer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellsort#Gap_sequences">Wikipedia</a> for more info.
    - Un-Stable Sort Algorithm
- Merge Sort
