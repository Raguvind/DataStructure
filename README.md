# Data Structures
------------------------
This project contains the various data structures and the implementation of the data structures using C#.

Tools Used:
 - VS Code

Below is the list of Data Structures and Algorithms that are part of the projects.

Data Structure
 - N/A

Sort Algorithm
 - Bubble Sort
    : In-Place Algorithm
    : O(n2) - Quadratic
    : Stable
 - Selection Sort
    : In-Place Algorithm
    : O(n2) - Quadratic
    : Un-Stable
    : Better than bubble sort, because the number of swaps is less than bubble sort
- Insertion Sort
    : In-Place Algorithm
    : O(n2) - Quadratic
    : Stable
